    <ul>
      <li>This tab is a splash page for introductions. Future visions for this page include a list of favorite food trucks and a display of current geolocation. With the proper effort and coding there could be a section to highlihgt events or locations.</li>
      <li>The second tab is the list of food trucks pulled from a static JSON file. Each card consists of the food truck's name, current-ish hours, and location. A share button is at the right end of each card. Future visions for this tab include adding a favorite button to the end of each card and having each card link to their own respective page with more information.</li>
      <li>The last tab is an about tab with contact information for thoughts or to submit any issues. A version number along with a fully featured contact form would be some ideas for future iterations.</li>
